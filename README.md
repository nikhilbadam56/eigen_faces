# eigen_faces
PCA and SVD are two algorithms used for dimensionality reduction problems in machine learning , deep learning ,data analytics etc.
They are also used in Image compression , this jupyter notebook demonstrates use of PCA and SVD for image compression.

## eigen faces visualization(basically they are eigen vectors in n dimensions, 'n' is number of pixels in one image below)
